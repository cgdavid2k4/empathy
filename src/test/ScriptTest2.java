/**
 * This example demonstrates how to make calls between
 * two different STA's.
 * First, to create an STA, you need to extend the STA class
 * and override its OnInit() method. This method will be called
 * in the STA's thread so you can use it to create your COM
 * components that will run in that STA.
 * If you then try to call methods on those components from other
 * threads (STA or MTA) - this will fail.
 * You cannot create a component in an STA and call its methods
 * from another thread.
 * You can use the DispatchProxy to get a proxy to any Dispatch
 * that lives in another STA. This object has to be created in the
 * STA that houses the Dispatch (in this case it's created in the
 * OnInit method). Then, another thread can call the toDispatch()
 * method of DispatchProxy to get a local proxy. At most ONE (!)
 * thread can call toDispatch(), and the call can be made only once.
 * This is because a IStream object is used to pass the proxy, and
 * it is only written once and closed when you read it.
 * If you need multiple threads to access a Dispatch pointer, then
 * create that many DispatchProxy objects.
