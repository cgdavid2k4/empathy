/**
 * If you need to pass a COM Dispatch object between STA threads, you
 * have to marshall the interface.
 * This class is used as follows: the STA that creates the Dispatch
 * object must construct an instance of this class. Another thread
 * can then call toDispatch() on that instance and get a Dispatch
 * pointer which has been marshalled.
 * WARNING: You can only call toDispatch() once! If you need to call
 * it multiple times (or from multiple threads) you need to construct
 * a separate DispatchProxy instance for each such case!
