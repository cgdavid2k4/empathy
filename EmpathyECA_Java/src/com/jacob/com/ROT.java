/**
 * The Running Object Table (ROT) maps each thread to a vector of
 * all the JacobObjects that were created in that thread. It always
 * operates on the current thread so all the methods are static and
 * they implicitly get the current thread.
 * Conceptually, this is similar to the ThreadLocal class of Java 1.2
 * but we are also supporting Java 1.6
 * The clearObjects method is used to release all the COM objects
 * created by Jacob in the current thread prior to uninitializing COM
 * for that thread. If we leave this job to the garbage collector,
 * then finalize might get called from a separate thread which is not
 * initialized for COM, and also the component itself may have been
 * freed.
